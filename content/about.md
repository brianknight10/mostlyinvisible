I try to write for my audience, not for myself, so this feels indulgent. When I think of expressing this kind of "about me" stuff in an article, I stop myself because it is not directly useful to you.

So this is just one big page where I can write all about myself, without feeling the need for it to be useful. And some day this site will be all that is left of me, so I might as well write my own mini autobiography.

## Me in 10 Seconds

I've been a dishwasher, grocery clerk, line cook, geologist, and software developer.

Irreverent, introvert, slow thinker, and always looking for a different point of view.

An American Yankee, I now live in Virginia, USA.

## Focused on Creating

More than anything, I want to make lots of stuff. I want to make articles, books, websites, maps, companies, systems, apps, and especially new ideas.

This shapes most of my life decisions. Saying no to almost everything, so I can have lots of time for making.

I also want to learn lots of stuff, especially different approaches to thinking and living. That is why I read so much non-fiction, and want to travel around the world.

I connect with those who stretch, strive, and grow. I cannot relate to those who chill, hang out, watch TV, party, etc. To be clear, I do this because it is what I find interesting. I have no ambitions of fame, wealth, or conventional success. I do not hustle. I am not building a personal brand. I do not count followers, clicks, visits, or any other vanity metrics.

I have optimized my life for creating and learning. I have cut out most things from my life that most other people do — (like hanging out or media consumption) — in pursuit of my bigger goal.

## My Life Philosophy

I have always had an uncommon approach to life, mostly shaped by my interests and curiosity. But when I [read a book on Stoicism](https://www.amazon.com/Meditations-Publisher-Library-Marcus-Aurelius/dp/B004TS8IJY/ref=sr_1_27) I realized I was not so unique. My own self-created philosophy lined up almost exactly with this ancient philosophy. So, if you want to know my approach to life, go [read this book](https://www.amazon.com/Guide-Good-Life-Ancient-Stoic/dp/0195374614/ref=sr_1_1). Especially the biggest point about strengthening yourself for a more difficult future.

I am also very skeptical, and was surprised to find that is also a philosophy. Meaning: for almost anything on this page, the opposite may also be true. I do not trust what I tell myself. It is not a lie — it is my truth at the time. But an opposite point of view can replace it when I shift my perspective. (I sometimes do this intentionally: do the opposite of my beliefs, just for a different perspective.)

## More About Me

- I think very long-term and future-focused. My present life is in service of my future self. I tend to do things for my future, not my present.

- I am wary of anything that feels like addiction. Whether drinking, phone/internet use, playing games, or whatever — if people tend to get an unhealthy addiction to it, I avoid it.

- I care deeply about very little. I am committed to just a few people and a few interests. Everything else, I keep away. It is a simple and sincere life.

- I walk away — to a fault. I am not a fighter. When something is not to my liking — or if something gets too confrontational or antagonistic — I just leave. Since I am happy being alone, the bar is set really high to make me engage with a person or situation that I am not enjoying.

- I am deliberate. I do not believe in the "I cannot help the way I am" approach to life. Only dead fish go with the flow. I change who I am to get what I want, instead of the other way around.

- I hate noise. I am always seeking silence. I do not like crowds, cities, bars, parties, streets, etc. So meeting people in noisy places is pointless, since I cannot understand what anyone is saying. It is another reason I prefer quiet one-on-one conversations.

- I hate to waste a single hour. I feel the precious value of time, most of the time. I imagine my time as worth $500 an hour, and ask myself what’s worth $500. Watching a TV show? Absolutely not. ("Game of Thrones" at 63 hours so far = $31,500 to watch.) Social media? Absolutely not. Focused learning or creating? Yep! Being with my family? Always.
