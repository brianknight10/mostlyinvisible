## Projects

The last couple of years have worn me down - COVID-19 and the pandemic, social change, job changes, family health struggles. I shelved a number of ideas and plans during that time and am finally beginning to make time to re-engage with those professional and personal projects. I am a slow-thinker and scanner. My ideas will develop at their own pace. 

## The Day Job

I left [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com) in January to join [Ippon Technologies](https://en.ippon.tech) as their new Head of Cloud. I miss Kickstarter a lot, but I have a great opportunity to build a "business within a business" around cloud technology.

## Reading!

My reading practice continues to be ecletic. Some current and recent books include:

- [_How To Live_](https://sive.rs/h) by Derek Sivers (I received a pre-publication copy)
- [_Heart of Darkness_](https://www.powells.com/book/heart-of-darkness-the-congo-diary-9780141441672) by Joseph Conrad
- [_Resilient Management_](https://resilient-management.com)  by Lara Hogan (Re-reading this excellent book)
- [_Tudors: The History of England from Henry VIII to Elizabeth I_](https://www.powells.com/book/tudors-9781250054609) by Peter Ackroyd

I eliminated daily news consumption to reduce noise and improve my mood. I read [_The Economist_](https://www.economist.com) weekly. I continue to make an exception for baseball news.

## Learning French

Learning French, using [Fluenz](https://fluenz.com/language/learn-french/) and the charity of my French colleagues at work.

## Love, Love, Love

Between my four wonderful kids and loving partner, my life is filled with a lot of love.
